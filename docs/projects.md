## Mathematical Biosciences Lab
Our lab is a multidisciplinary research team at the interface of mathematics and biology/life sciences. As part of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, we are a dynamic research group led by Prof Cang Hui, a SARChI Chair in Mathematical and Theoretical Physical Biosciences. Our interests lie in proposing models and theories for explaining emerging patterns in ecology. Ecology studies biodiversity in its variety and complexity. As ecological processes are highly complex and adaptive, we rely on the simplicity of mathematical language to build models and theoretical frameworks.

## BioMath Projects
The Projects section showcases a collection of ongoing and past research initiatives led by the BioMath Lab. These projects span various domains, from ecosystem modeling to advanced computational tools, each dedicated to addressing complex ecological and biological questions through quantitative analysis and innovative methodologies. Here, you’ll find detailed information on the objectives, methodologies, and impacts of each project, providing insights into our lab’s contributions to advancing scientific knowledge in biodiversity and environmental sciences. Each project page, like Science-i, offers a closer look at specific projects, including their aims, key findings, and how they align with our broader goals of fostering sustainable, data-driven solutions for ecosystem conservation and biodiversity monitoring.
